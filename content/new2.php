    <h4>We will not classify programming languages ​​in any order. In the world of 
    technology, the graph of programming languages ​​changes according to the needs 
    of the times, and accordingly we mention some important languages:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>C++:</strong>The language that does not die and it is a multi-use language,

        that need speed and flexibility, so it occupied a large section in 
        relation to artificial intelligence applications and built a lot of 
        libraries for this purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>PHP:</strong> a language used in programming websites, and it 
        is a powerful language and a high percentage of websites are built using 
        it, and it is dedicated to the part of the website related to servers and
