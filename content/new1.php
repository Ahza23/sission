<strong><p>Whatever your specialty in life, you must have heard about programming 
    languages, or you may have thought how a computer or smartphone works, who is 
    building this or that website, and other questions that will be answered.. 
    Programming languages.</p></strong>
    
    <h4>What are the programming languages:</h4>
    <p>Programming language: It is the language in which humans communicate with 
    the computer, and in other words, it is the means that makes us control the 
    behavior of the computer, as these languages vary between several levels, and 
    they are not only zeros and ones as some think, but rather they are multiple 
    levels, but all of them are eventually converted to zeros and ones or the 
    so-called machine language, and the levels of these languages are:</p>
    <h5>
        <ul>
            <li>High-level languages: such as C# - Python - PHP.</li>
            <li>Low-level languages: such as Assembly.</li>
            <li>Machine language: It is the language of zeros and ones.</li>
        </ul>
    </h5>
    <h4>How does the programming language deal with the computer?</h4>
    <p>Of course, this depends on the level of the programming language, and 
    in general, programming languages ​​change from their written form to the 
    language of the machine, as the computer and whatever development the 
    language in which it works is the language of zeros and ones, so we have 
    to know basically that all languages ​​end up in the language of the machine 
    in some way .</p>
    <p>This method is about converting the language from one form to a simpler 
    using translators that translate from one language to another, as some 
    programming languages ​​such as C++ are translated to a lower level 
    language, Assembly, and then to a lower level, which is the language of 
    zeros and ones.</p>
    <p>Most high-level languages ​​are written using simple English with a well-known 
    set of signs that are arranged differently from one language to another, and 
    this is one of the things that distinguishes languages ​​from one another.</p>
    <h4>Uses of programming languages</h4>
    <p>Programming languages vary in terms of their uses to include operating 
        systems, office applications, Internet applications, websites, and 
        smartphone applications. Each programming language has different 
        capabilities and characteristics from the other. Among the uses of 
        programming languages are:</p>
    <h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Operating system languages: C++ - Assembly - C.</li>
            <li>Office application languages: C# - Java - Python.</li>
            <li>Website languages: JavaScript - PHP - Python.</li>
            <li>Mobile application languages: Java - Swift - Object C.</li>
        </ul>
