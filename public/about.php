<h1>All about me</h1>

<p>My name is Ahmed Zaytoun and I am 23 years old. I have recently moved 
to Karlskrona from Bor√•s to study at Blekinge Institute of Technology 
for web programming. I came to Sweden with my family in 2015 due to the 
war in my country where I do not have the opportunity to fulfill my dreams, 
so I moved here. I would describe myself as a very determined and very motivated 
person and now I am investing in being able to manage in this program with a lot 
of experience to be able to use it in working life. I usually work out at the gym 
and I have it as a hobby in my spare time. My goal is to finish all the courses 
and gain a lot of experience and try to introduce this later after the study.</p>
